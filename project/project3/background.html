  <h1>Background Research</h1>

  <p>
    There are 3500 Chinese international students studying at UC Davis, and 1500,000 studying all over the world. They are facing lots of problems that haven’t been solved very well by both U.S. society and Chinese society. Disfluent language, an unfamiliar lifestyle, no family nearby and expensive accommodations are barriers to international Chinese students’ adaptation to college life in the U.S. They have the same pain point: loneliness in a totally new environment, and different lifestyle.
<br><br>
    According to “Data check: Why do Chinese and Indian students come to U.S. universities?” by Jeffrey Mervis, 31.5% of the 886,000 international students at American college in 2013 and 2014 came from China. They have a common goal, which is to pursue higher education and learn more about American life. Thus, most of them study hard and have high GPAs, because they believe that studying is most vital way to success.
<br><br>
    According to my interviews of Chinese students at UC Davis, I discovered that posting pictures and video on social media is one of the best ways to put themselves out there. Posting the latest pictures and videos about their experiences is a way to keep a record of American daily life, share it with others and get connect and support from online friends under the same background. Furthermore, I discovered that this discourse community have crazy love to food. They love hometown food, and spend 1/3 money per month on food. Food is also a heated topic for them to communicate with friends. Thus, a food community and food delivery app can both satisfy their social needs and necessary needs of food.
<br><br>
    Furthermore, I search some relative food relative app and social network app. Yelp is one of it. Yelp connect people with local business and it lets users search and review businesses around, but also allows them to engage with other users by creating their own profile, sharing their collections, posting reviews, adding friends, chatting in forums, etc. Another one is Zhihu App, which is a UGC and PGC content community in which question will be answered. peer exchange of interest with the exchange of knowledge and experience of the topic group to meet the content needs of the questioner to meet the self-fulfilling needs of respondents, contributing to the knowledge base; rich content to promote high-quality knowledge-intensive search engine. Overall, those app focus on two functions in one app, social network and food order function.
