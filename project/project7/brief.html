  <h1>Project Brief</h1>
  <h3>Topic summary</h3>
  <h4>The topic of my project is a food delivery and food community app specifically for Chinese international students. According to my research, influent language, an unfamiliar lifestyle, no family nearby and expensive food are barriers to international Chinese students’ adaptation to college life in the U.S. They have the same pain point: loneliness in a totally new environment, and different food preferrence. Food is also a heated topic for them to communicate with friends. Thus, a food community and food delivery app can both satisfy their social needs and necessary needs of food.
