  <h1>Comparative Research</h1>
  <h2>Airbnb Analysis</h2>
  <p>Airbnb is an apartment-resource shared platform which promotes individuals’ interaction by sharing own surplus apartment to others. It is a way to keep people from diverse cultural background to live in one apartment together and communicate more. It helps diverse cultures interconnect but may also conflict with each other. It is similar to my idea, an online international student community providing social needs and basic needs, such as apartment leasing, entertaining, food delivery.
<br><br>
The interaction design of Airbnb is simple and smooth. The transition called by a click between pages is spatially interactive. The unified transitional effects between each page are scrolled up from the button. Furthermore, the images located in the detail page is automatically scrolled. On the map page, the upper part is map, button is the lists of apartment. When clicking apartment, the map will automatically jump to the corresponding position.
<br><br>
The User interface design still follows the simplicity style. Firstly, in the pure white background, bold and light San Francisco typography in dark grey color looks neat. It stands out pretty good in the mobile screen, small but enough for audience to read the information with hierarchy. Then, the button color is the same as the logo color, following the branding design. The second color chosen is dark green, used as banner and some emphasized texts. In addition, for the edge of each block and images are curved, which makes the whole design more comfortable and friendly. All the assets of the App are consistent and clear. It emphasizes the content from the users stands out better rather than focus too much on its own app design. Thus, when people use the app, what they remember are the images and information they pursue, instead of too much graphics design or irrelevant contents.
<br><br>
However, I dislike the top fixed search bar with a white boring white background. I prefer to delete the white background and make the bar floating on top of the whole page.

  <h2>Uber Analysis</h2>
  <p>Uber is an O2O (online to offline) platform to provide transportation service. Offline part, the car drivers own, is a cultural hub, where the people all over the world may meet at. It also provides the app an issue to concern is the diversity of users’ background. However, Uber eats is the sub application working together with Uber, using the driving service to do the food delivery service.
<br><br>
The design of the App is related to the style of Uber itself. The color and typography of the app is the same as Uber, which emphasis the branding of the company. Overall its style is currently the most popular one: card style. Each post just like a card in the screen, big images in rectangular shape. The benefit of the style is providing minimum information that users care most when browsing and comparing. It maximizes the efficiency of the screen space’s usage. Thus, information design does matter in the design. Limited text and big images highly rely on the size, position, color to give the hierarchy of understanding.
<br><br>
Moreover, the interaction style of the Uber-eats is much better than Airbnb. Every action is more dynamic. When I click to open one image to get to the detail page, the transitional effect is that all the typography and blocks in the later page with scrolling up active. The transition of the text box or the text itself make the whole interactive experience more comfortable and natural. It seems like the interaction should be like this without any adaptation to it.
<br><br>
To analyze how the app facing the diversity, it pays attention to the diversity of users ‘diverse eating habits, vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. It shows its expertise and its respect to the difference of the users.
